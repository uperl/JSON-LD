  # ABSTRACT: Load and dump JSON files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use JSON::LD;

 DumpFile("foo.json", { a => 1 });
 my $data - LoadFile("foo.json:");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ever want to load JSON from a file?  Ever forget which module it is that you are
supposed to be using now?  Is it L<JSON> or L<JSON::PP> or L<JSON::XS> or
L<JSON::Syck> or L<Cpanel::JSON::XS> (how many Ns are in Cpanel?  For some reason
I am bad at spelling) or L<JSON::MaybeXS> or 
C<JSON::XS::TheNextForkBecausePreviousMaintainerTurnedOutToBeADouche>.
Which file mode are you supposed to be using again?  It's UTF-8 but I think I'm
supposed to read it as binary?  I forget and I have a headache now.

This module is for you.  It uses a similar interface to L<YAML> for loading
and dumping files.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

All functions are exported by default.

=head2 DumpFile

 DumpFile($filename, $data);

Dumps the data in C<$data> to C<$filename> as properly encoded JSON.  If C<$data>
cannot be represented as JSON or if there is an IO error it will throw an
exception.

=head2 LoadFile

 my $data = LoadFile($filename);

Loads the data in JSON format from C<$filename>.  If the JSON in C<$filename>
is not properly formatted or encoded or if there is an IO error it will throw
an exception.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module is a parody.  However the struggle is real.
